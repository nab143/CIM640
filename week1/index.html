     <p>My name is Nicole Barba. I graduated Monmouth University in May 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications â€“ Radio/Television and Public Relations/Journalism and a minor in Interactive Media. I come from Marlboro, New Jersey. I have picked up many skills along the way, becoming an expert in social media from both a professional and personal standpoint. My range of works covers various aspects in my field of study. This includes writing, editing sound and video, and film production. Programs that I am skilled in include Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer, Microsoft Office, Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, and Audition. I am currently a student at the University of Miami seeking a MFA in Interactive Media.</p>

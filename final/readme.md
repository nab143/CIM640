# Code Plan

## This program provides user interaction related to constellations. Users can use the mouse to hover over each constellation image on the top of the screen to see the name. They can also draw their own constellation by dragging the mouse in the canvas and changing the star colors using a slider. The user can download their constellation as a png with the press of a button. There is a quiz for users to take to see how much general information they know about constellations. By clicking submit, the quiz will output a text telling the user how well they did. On the right side of the page, users can input their birth date information into a text box and click the submit button to find out their correct zodiac sign.
